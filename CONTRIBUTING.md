# Contributing

This is how `CONTRIBUTING.md` files for each of Webstone Technologies' customers look like. It takes 1 command to install [Devbox](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox/), and 1 command to get started with any project.

## Prerequisites

Run the following command once to install [Devbox](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox/).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.jetify.com/devbox | bash
```

## Get Started

For any project that is configured with Devbox, run the following command.

```bash
devbox services up
```

That's it.
